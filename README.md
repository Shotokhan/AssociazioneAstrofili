Java project based on a SE exam practice.

The exam practice consists in an implementation of an enterprise-like Java application using SE principles, implementing
a relational DB, connecting to it with JDBC, making tests and following patterns. I'm going beyond the exam practice:
the idea is to implement all the use cases and the full DB, alongside with the DAO classes; maybe, at the end, adding
some "networking" to implement a basic client/server model and after that maybe I could also add a basic GUI.
